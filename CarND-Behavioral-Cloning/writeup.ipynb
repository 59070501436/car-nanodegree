    "# Writeup - Behavioral Cloning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my writeup on the behavioral cloning project. This notebook contains both discussion and source code for each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior\n",
    "* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images\n",
    "* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set\n",
    "* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road\n",
    "* Summarize the results with a written report"

    "## Rubric Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `model.py` containing the script to create and train the model (but you can see all the code in this notebook too!)\n",
    "* `drive.py` for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* `model.h5` containing a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* `writeup.ipynb` the report you are reading now\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying some models (including the model described in this [Nvidia paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316)), I found a simple model that works very well (thanks to the awesome Udacity community), receiving as input images with shape 20x40x3. Impressive!\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer. We add four fully connected layers in the final layers. The model also includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer. See the implementation details in the cell below."
